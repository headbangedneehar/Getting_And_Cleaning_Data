NOTE: 
=================

The experiments have been carried out with a group of 30 volunteers within an age bracket of 19-48 years. Each person performed six activities (WALKING, WALKING_UPSTAIRS, WALKING_DOWNSTAIRS, SITTING, STANDING, LAYING) wearing a smartphone (Samsung Galaxy S II) on the waist. Using its embedded accelerometer and gyroscope, 3-axial linear acceleration and 3-axial angular velocity at a constant rate of 50Hz were captured. The experiments have been video-recorded to label the data manually.
The sensor signals (accelerometer and gyroscope) were pre-processed by applying noise filters and then sampled in fixed-width sliding windows of 2.56 sec and 50% overlap. The sensor acceleration signal, which has gravitational and body motion components, was separated using a Butterworth low-pass filter into body acceleration and gravity. The gravitational force is assumed to have only low frequency components, therefore a filter with 0.3 Hz cutoff frequency was used. From each window, a vector of features was obtained by calculating variables from the time and frequency domain.

For each record it is provided:
- An identifier of the subject who carried out the experiment.
- Its activity label. 
- A 66-feature vector with time and frequency domain variables. 
- Mean of Triaxial acceleration from the accelerometer (total acceleration) and the estimated body acceleration for each subject per activity.
- Mean of Triaxial Angular velocity from the gyroscope for each subject per activity. 

Feature Selection 
=================

The features selected for this database come from the accelerometer and gyroscope 3-axial raw signals TimeAcc-XYZ and TimeGyro-XYZ. These time domain signals were captured at a constant rate of 50 Hz. Then they were filtered using a median filter and a 3rd order low pass Butterworth filter with a corner frequency of 20 Hz to remove noise. Similarly, the acceleration signal was then separated into body and gravity acceleration signals (TimeBodyAcc-XYZ and TimeGravityAcc-XYZ) using another low pass Butterworth filter with a corner frequency of 0.3 Hz. 

Subsequently, the body linear acceleration and angular velocity were derived in time to obtain Jerk signals (0BodyAccJerk-XYZ and tBodyGyroJerk-XYZ). Also the magnitude of these three-dimensional signals were calculated using the Euclidean norm (TimeBodyAccMag, TimeGravityAccMag, TimeBodyAccJerkMag, TimeBodyGyroMag, TimeBodyGyroJerkMag). 

Finally a Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) was applied to some of these signals producing FFTBodyAcc-XYZ, FFTBodyAccJerk-XYZ, FFTBodyGyro-XYZ, FFTBodyAccJerkMag, FFTBodyGyroMag, FFTBodyGyroJerkMag and mean(): Mean value and std(): Standard deviation were estimated from these signals. For each of the mean() and std() computed for each window, mean of values for each subject per activity were tabularized to get resulting data set.
